# ðŸŽ® Nestor

**Nestor** is a work-in-progress **NES emulator** written in **Kotlin** for the JVM.

It aims to bring the joy and challenge of retro gaming to life with clean, modern code â€” one scanline at a time.

## ðŸš€ Project Goals

- âœ… Learn systems programming by emulating 8-bit hardware
- âœ… Build an educational and approachable emulator
- âœ… Keep it fun, modular, and focused
- âœ… Eventually play real NES games â€” with sound, input, and sprites

## ðŸ§± Roadmap

The emulator is being built in the following stages:

1. **First Frame**  
   Parse ROMs and render a static background using the PPU.

2. **Intro Playback**  
   Emulate CPU and PPU enough to animate the title screen.

3. **Sprite Rendering**  
   Add support for characters, enemies, and dynamic objects.

4. **Input Handling**  
   Connect a USB gamepad via JInput to control games.

5. **Audio Output**  
   Simulate the APU and stream sound through JVM audio.
